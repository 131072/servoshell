# servoshell

This is a sandbox project. Prototyping and experimenting with embedding Servo.
The code compiles and run, but it's messy and memory management is non existent.

It requires a patched version of winit, cocoa-rs and webrender. See Cargo.toml.

The master branch is not functional. Use the `with_glutin_and_no_xib` if you want to test the application.

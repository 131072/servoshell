# servoshell

This is a sandbox project. Prototyping and experimenting with embedding Servo.
The code compiles and run, but it's messy and memory management is non existent.

It requires a patched version of cocoa-rs and servo. See Cargo.toml.

Create the dot-app with: [`cargo bundle`](https://github.com/burtonageo/cargo-bundle]).

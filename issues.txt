- app icon
- shift content when tabbar is visible
- add a icon to toggle tabbar

- we need a mapping nswindow -> Widgets.
- then, have a global set of delegate methods, that will get the keyWindow (msg_send![NSApp(), keyWindow)
- get Widgets, add event or perform widget actions
- build menu bound to  delegate methods
- from here, build "Open Location" (focus urlbar)
- implement urlbar

- multiwindow: multiNSWindow first maybe, with tabbed view
  (nswindow added to the tabview via https://developer.apple.com/reference/appkit/nswindow/1855947-addtabbedwindow)

To file:
- make it possible to either screenshot the pipeline (copy the NSOpenGLVIew into a NSImage)
- add a hook for navigation


Next: look at: [NSApp performSelector:@selector(terminate:) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.0];

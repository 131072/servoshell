- we need a mapping nswindow -> Widgets.
- then, have a global set of delegate methods, that will get the keyWindow (msg_send![NSApp(), keyWindow)
- get Widgets, add event or perform widget actions
- build menu bound to  delegate methods
- from here, build "Open Location" (focus urlbar)
- implement urlbar

- multiwindow: multiNSWindow first maybe, with tabbed view
  (nswindow added to the tabview via https://developer.apple.com/reference/appkit/nswindow/1855947-addtabbedwindow)
